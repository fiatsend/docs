# **Fiatsend Network Architecture**

The Fiatsend Network is designed to **seamlessly connect individuals, businesses, and liquidity providers** into a unified decentralized financial ecosystem. It is built on four key participants: **Users, Merchants, Agents, and Liquidity Providers**, each playing a critical role in ensuring smooth and efficient fiat-to-crypto transactions.

## **How These Components Work Together**

1️⃣ **Users** initiate transactions (sending, receiving, or converting funds).  
2️⃣ **Merchants** process payments, using Fiatsend’s APIs for settlements.  
3️⃣ **Agents** facilitate cash-in and cash-out services for users needing local fiat access.  
4️⃣ **Liquidity Providers** ensure smooth transactions by supplying crypto and fiat liquidity.

Together, these components **power the Fiatsend Network**, ensuring a **seamless, fast, and reliable** payment experience for individuals, businesses, and financial institutions.
