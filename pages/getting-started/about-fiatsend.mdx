# Getting Started

## What is Fiatsend?

Fiatsend enables conversion of stablecoins into local fiat currencies through fiat tokenization. It is designed to simplify transactions for users of all levels, whilst incentivizing users.

## Who is Fiatsend For?

- **Web3 Users**: Those familiar with wallet connections and blockchain.
- **Traditional users**: Individuals who know nothing about crypto with no experience using stablecoins.

## How it Works

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account using your wallet or email. For Web3 users you can mint an NFT (ERC 721) which represents your mobile wallet or IBAN.
2. **Complete KYC**: Optionally you can verify your identity to unlock higher transaction limits. Non KYCed users can still perform a transaction up to $200.00.
3. **Transfer Stablecoins**: Send USDC or USDT and receive tokenized fiat.
4. **Receive Fiat**: Funds are instantly processed on our settlement layer to the payment method of your choice based on your NFT properties.
