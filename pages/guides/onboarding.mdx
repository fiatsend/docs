## Fiatsend Onboarding Guide

### Step 1: Wallet Connection or Email Login

After connecting your wallet or logging in with an email (embedded wallet), your wallet is checked for the FSNFT (Fiatsend Account NFT), which represents your account.

### Step 2: Onboarding Page

If the FSNFT does not exist, you will be redirected to the onboarding page.

### Step 3: Choose Mobile Money Operator

Select your mobile money operator and enter your mobile number.

### Step 6: Offramping USDT/USDC

You can send USDT/USDC directly from your wallet to `fiatsend.eth` or interact with the contract directly. Payment is processed on the settlement layer and reaches your account within a few seconds.
