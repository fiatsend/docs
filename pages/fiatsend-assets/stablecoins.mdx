## Stablecoins Used for Off-Ramping (USDC & USDT)

Fiatsend uses **USDC** (USD Coin) and **USDT** (Tether) as the primary stablecoins to enable seamless off-ramping between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. Here's how they work:

### Role in Off-Ramping:

- **USDC** and **USDT** are transferred to **fiatsend.eth** from registered non custodial wallet or interaction can be done directly from our dapp with your connected wallet. Once deposited, these stablecoins trigger an instant conversion to a local fiat currency which is then sent to the user's settlement account (eg: mobile money wallet).

### Key Features of USDC & USDT:

- **Stable Value**: Both USDC and USDT maintain a 1:1 peg to the US Dollar, ensuring users are not exposed to the volatility of other cryptocurrencies.
- **Fast Transactions**: These stablecoins provide fast and low-cost cross-border payments, making them ideal for global remittance solutions.
- **Global Accessibility**: Users worldwide can send and receive stablecoins, ensuring universal access to the Fiatsend platform.

### Benefits:

- **No Volatility**: Users sending or receiving stablecoins can avoid the price fluctuations seen in other cryptocurrencies.
- **Liquidity**: Both USDC and USDT offer high liquidity, facilitating instant conversion and settlement between crypto and fiat currencies.
- **Seamless Integration**: USDC and USDT are directly integrated with the Fiatsend platform, making them easy to use for off-ramping and conversions.

### How USDC & USDT Work in Fiatsend:

- When a user sends USDC or USDT to **fiatsend.eth**, the stablecoin is automatically converted to the equivalent fiat amount (e.g., ghsFIAT) and sent to the user's settlement account, ensuring quick and seamless transactions.
